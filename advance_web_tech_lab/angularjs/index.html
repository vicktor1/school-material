<!-- Now, it's time to make the web page dynamic -- with AngularJS. We will also add
	a test that verifies the code for the controller we are going to add.
	There are many ways to structure the code for an application. For AngularJS 
	applications, we encourage the use of the ModelViewController design patter to
	decouple the code and separate concerns. With that in mind, Let's use a little
	AngularJS and Javascript to add models, views, and controllers to our app.

<ul>
	<li>
		<span>Nexus S</span>
		<p>
			Fast just got faster with Nexus S.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<span>Motorola XOOM with Wi-Fi</span>
		<p>
		The Next, Next Generation tablet.

	</li>
</ul>
